# Basketball-Half-court-clip-statistics
Clip highlight of half court 4V4, 3V3 videos automatically, and generate statistics automatically.

# What we need

* A model to detect/recognize human
* Combined can get the last N seconds before the basketball falls into the net
* Exclude the time range that are in shift time
